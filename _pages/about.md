**Candidate of UW CFRM Program**

Welcome! I am Hao, currently a Master of Science candidate in the Computational Finance & Risk Management program at Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington. I am in pursuit of a career as a quantitative analyst, using data and mathematical modeling to optimize business operations. Take a look at my [Data Analysis](https://hzcfrm.github.io/DataAnalysis/) and [Quantitative Finance](https://hzcfrm.github.io/QuantitativeFinance/) pages, where I show my projects work in relevant fields.

**In Industry: Business Operations and Client Support**

Prior to joining UW CFRM, I gained my industry experience from two internships. When I worked as the Business Operations Analyst at Global Courier Express, I participated in every aspect of business operations of a supply chain provider. This enabled me to apply my business acumen and quantitative analytical skills to deliver data-driven business optimization. Before that, I had another experience in Fintech industry working as a Client Support Analyst at Argus Merchant Services. This is when I worked directly with customers and merchants from various industries, which provided me even more business insights. As I quickly grab new techinical skills everyday, I found myself passionate about acquiring valuable information from real-world data, not only to better support the clients, but also give actionable marketing strategies to the sales team.


**Once A Scarlet Knight**

I would never forget my days and months spent at my undergraduate institution, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, where I earned my Bachelor's degree with a double major in Mathematics and Finance. As I keep going forward, from coast to coast, I always keep my thankful heart, for the place I built my dreams.
